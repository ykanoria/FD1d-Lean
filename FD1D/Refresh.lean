# Explicit initialization by labeled refresh

During the first `m` requests, label `k` is matched and replaced at step
`k < m`.  Labels below `k` have already been refreshed, while labels at or
above `k` still denote the original supply.  This makes it impossible for
the initialization schedule to delete a previously refreshed label.

`Spatial.lean` is deliberately not imported here: its current dependency on
the transport development is transient.  Exact coordinates are instead
parameterized by a unit-interval location rule.  The count projection and
its law are independent of that rule.
